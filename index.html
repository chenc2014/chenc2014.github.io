&quot;The long-term health effects of early-life malaria exposure: Evidence from Taiwan's malaria eradication in the 1950s,&quot;<a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/724216">[published version]</a>

<div class="inner_div" ><div id="Div1" style = "display:none; font-size: 14px" >This paper attempts to examine how malaria eradication in Taiwan during the 1950s, which successfully wiped out malaria within a short period, affected long-term health. Relying on three data sets covering the entire population of Taiwan, we construct diverse measures of health, including health-care utilization, functional abilities, chronic diseases, and catastrophic illnesses. Our results indicate that people who experienced larger reductions in early-life malaria exposure tend to have better health status as adults, especially women. Our results suggest a sizable cost saving from the eradication program that improves early-life environment and helps to avoid costly diseases at a later point.

&quot;Family size, labor supply, and job prestige: Evidence from three decennial censuses in China,&quot;
<br><div class="buttons">Cheng Chen, Ying-Min Kuo, and Wangyang Zhao, <em>China Economic Review</em>, 80: 101986, Aug 2023. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chieco.2023.101986"> [published version]</a><a href="#" onclick="divVisibility('Div2');">[show/hide abstract]</a></div>
<div class="inner_div" ><div id="Div2" style = "display:none; font-size: 14px">This study investigates the relationship between family size and parents’ labor market performance, measured by labor supply and occupational prestige scores, based on three census waves in 1990, 2000, and 2010. To address the endogeneity problem of family size, we use the indicator of twins at first birth as an instrumental variable. Our results suggest that in nuclear households, family size affects the labor market performance only of mothers, not of fathers, with the negative effects fading and gradually disappearing over time. More specifically, an increase in family size decreases female labor supply in the 1990 wave, leads to lower prestige scores among working mothers in the 2000 wave, and has no impact on labor supply or occupational prestige scores in the 2010 wave. Our subsample analysis indicates that the negative effects of family size are more severe for parents of households with all children under seven years old and for husbands or wives with lower education level than that of their partners. In addition, we find that the negative effects of family size on parental labor market outcomes are not observed in extended households, especially when no grandparents are aged 65 years or older.
